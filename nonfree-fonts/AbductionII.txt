For whatever reason, Abduction has turned out to be my most popular
font. It has been used on a variety of web sites and company logos.
For that reason, I decided to dig further into the phenomenon called
abduction. This font, Abduction II - The Case For, is the first font
created from the DNA of the original. Unfortunately, "The Case For"
alien abduction consists of only personal experiences without hard, 
documentable evidence. Thus "The Case For" is merely an outline of
the experience, void of the substance necessary to assemble solid,
irrefutable proof. Coming soon: Abduction III - The Case Against.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
do want to make a donation to encourage me to continue my creative
efforts, send it to the address above. (Yeah....As If!) Thanks & Enjoy!
