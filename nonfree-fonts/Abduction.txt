extended characters and punctuation.

############ EMBEDDABLE FONTS ############
NOTE: This font is coded so that it can be embedded in MS Word (.DOC)
documents. Thus, if you use this font in an MS Word document and save
the document with the font embedded, the recipient of the document will
see it with this font even though they may not have the font loaded on
their system. To embed a font in an MS Word document select "Tools"
from the MS Word menu bar and then select "Options". Under the "Save"
tab, check the box marked "Embed True Type fonts".  VOILA !
(The recipient must open the document in MS Word for this to work.)

NOTE TO PERSONAL USERS: Maybe, just maybe, you'll make a fortune using
this font in some manner. If you do, all I ask is that you remember me
with a token of your appreciation. Any modest amount (at least $1 and
not to exceed $1,000,000) would be an appropriate gesture for my
contribution to your monumental financial success. Hey! I can dream!

The character set includes:

Upper and lower (Alternate) case letters, numbers, most punctuation, 
extended and international characters.

Oh, yeah....I almost forgot. If (for some unknown reason) you really
