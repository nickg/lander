                INSTALLATION

See the file for INSTALL for Unix installation instructions.

There is an (out-of-date) XCode project in Lander.xcodeproj. This may need some
work before it will build. On the other hand, the instructions in INSTALL should
work on OS X, and since you have the source code already... ;-)

Windows users should probably download the pre-built binary. If you want to
compile it your self there is a Visual Studio 2003 project in
msvc/Lander. You'll need the development versions of FreeType, SDL, SDL_Mixer,
and SDL_Image.

                BUGS

On Windows after changing the resolution or toggling full-screen mode all images
appear as white boxes. The workaround is to restart the program.
